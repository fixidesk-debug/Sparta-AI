# Image Loading Error Fix

## Problem
The application was showing multiple "Image failed to load" errors in the console when displaying charts generated from data analysis.

## Root Cause
The errors were occurring because:
1. Base64-encoded images from matplotlib were not being properly validated before rendering
2. Error handling was insufficient to diagnose the actual issue
3. No validation was in place to catch malformed or incomplete image data

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend - Chat Messages Component (`frontend/src/components/chat/chat-messages.tsx`)
- Added comprehensive validation for base64 image data URLs
- Checks for:
  - Missing or null image sources
  - Invalid data URL format
  - Empty or too-short base64 data
  - Invalid base64 characters
- Enhanced error logging with detailed information about failed images
- Displays user-friendly error messages when images fail to load

### 2. Frontend - Chat Hook (`frontend/src/hooks/use-chat.ts`)
- Added validation before creating markdown image URLs
- Validates base64 format using regex pattern
- Checks minimum length requirements
- Enhanced logging to track image processing
- Shows warning messages for invalid images instead of failing silently

### 3. Backend - Code Executor (`backend/app/services/code_executor.py`)
- Added validation for image data before base64 encoding
- Checks for empty image data from matplotlib
- Validates base64 encoding result
- Enhanced logging with image sizes and previews
- Skips invalid images instead of including them in the response

## How to Test

1. **Restart the backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Restart the frontend development server:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test with a data analysis query:**
   - Upload a CSV file
   - Ask a question that generates visualizations (e.g., "Show me a bar chart of the data")
   - Check the browser console for detailed logging

4. **Expected Behavior:**
   - Valid images should load and display properly
   - Invalid images will show a warning message instead of a console error
   - Console will show detailed validation information for debugging

## Console Output to Look For

### Success Case:
```
Chart 1 validation: {originalLength: 12345, cleanedLength: 12345, startsWidth: "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAA...", endsWidth: "...AASUVORK5CYII="}
Rendering image: {srcLength: 12367, srcPreview: "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAA", alt: "Chart 1"}
Image loaded successfully: Chart 1
```

### Error Case (with helpful info):
```
Chart 1 has invalid base64 characters
// OR
Chart 1 is too short (50 chars)
// OR
Base64 data is too short or empty: 0
```

## Additional Notes

- The validation is non-destructive - valid images will work exactly as before
- Invalid images now show clear error messages instead of silent failures
- All validation errors are logged to help diagnose issues
- The fix handles both frontend and backend validation layers

## If Images Still Fail to Load

Check the following:
1. **Backend logs** - Look for messages about figure capture and base64 encoding
2. **Frontend console** - Check the detailed validation messages
3. **Network tab** - Verify the API response contains the images array
4. **Image size** - Very large images might cause issues (check base64 length)
5. **Matplotlib version** - Ensure matplotlib is properly installed in the backend

## Next Steps

If you continue to see errors after these changes:
1. Check the console for the specific validation error
2. Look at the backend logs for image capture issues
3. Verify that matplotlib is generating valid PNG data
4. Check if there are any CORS or CSP issues in the browser
